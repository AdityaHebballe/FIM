# File Integrity Monitor
A File Integrity Monitor or FIM is a security process that tracks changes to files, ensuring they haven't been altered, added, or deleted without authorization.
I have implemented 2 versions of a FIM for Windows and Linux using:
  1) **Level-1:** Hashing
  2) **Level-2:** System Calls
